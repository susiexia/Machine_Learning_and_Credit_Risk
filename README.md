# Machine_Learning_and_Credit_Risk

Perdict credit risk with Machine Learning Models in Python

Project Background

Using Python to build and evaluate several supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions better predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.
